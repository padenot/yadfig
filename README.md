# yadfig, a damn fine image gallery generator

## Once was genethumb.sh…

Yes, it worked quite nicely, but it was kind of ugly and sucked (according to
its creator). At the price of a few dependencies (`pyexiv2` and PIL, since I don't
consider python to be a real dependency on a machine that will host pictures),
you can have something much nicer (in my point of view).

As `genethumb.sh`, is produces a single HTML file, which should work in any
reasonably recent web browser (since it uses HTML5 & co. delicacies), and is very
easy to host on any web server, without having to use any server side
programming, hopefully increasing speed and security.

I could write for hours, but nothing would bet a working demo, so here they are:

## Ok, I'm convinced, what next ?

### I just want to use it, you know…
Then grab `yadfig` in the download section, make sure to have `pyexiv2` & `PIL`
installed (as well as Python, of course), and you're good to go.

### I want to build it myself from source…

You need to install the dependencies : `jsmin` and a couple Python libraries. On
a Debian-like system, this line should do the job:

    sudo aptitude install python-pyexiv2 python-imaging

The build script uses `sed` (any flavor) and `tr`, but everybody should have
those. Also, put a copy of `jsmin` (compiled from 
[this file](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.c)), and put it somewhere in
the `$PATH`. `pyexiv2` should be in version 0.3, there is an API compatibility
break somewhere in the previous versions.

Speaking of build script, here are the steps to install it when dependencies are
satisfied :

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/padenot/yadfig
cd yadfig
./build.sh
chmod +x yadfig
mv yadfig ~/bin # or other directory in $PATH
````

## Usage

To enjoy `yadfig`, go to a directory which happen to contain pictures
(it supports all formats that PIL support, and there's formats you probably
_never heard about_), and invoke :

```
yadfig
```

An `index.html` file should appear, as well as a `.c` directory containing
thumbnails. If you want to, you can invoke it that way :

```
yadfig -p "The location where the photo were taken" -t "A title"
```

It produces a somewhat nicer output.

If you need more details about the execution of the process, just add the verbose option:

```
yadfig -p "The location" -t "The title" -v
```

Do you have a lot of images directories and you don't want to launch yadfig in each one? No problem!
yadfig knows how to generate a collection of albums, with the recursive option. Just launch it from the
directory containing the albums:

```
yadfig -t "Example" -r -d /media/photos/ -b "/galeries/example/"
```

(note that -b gives the url of the base directory containing the sub directories.)
This one produces a gallery like [this one](http://benjb.gagahome.fr/galeries/example/).

## Yeah, but it doesn't do _that_ !
Patches are welcome, but the whole thing is aimed at simplicity.

## It's broken, I use IE or Opera !
I haven't tested IE, and Opera for 30 seconds, and it silently failed. There are
great free and open-source browser you can try instead that happen to work.

## Your code is crappy !
I know, I just started with js and web stuff. The codebase quality will
eventually get better with time. If you see something really nasty, drop me a
line at [@padenot](http://twitter.com/padenot) or somewhere else.

Contact [@njbenji](http://twitter.com/njbenji) for every complaint related to
recursive processing.
